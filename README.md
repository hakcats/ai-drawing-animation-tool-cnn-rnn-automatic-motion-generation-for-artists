# üé® Drawing Animation ‚Äì AI-Powered Animation Tool

**Drawing Animation** is an AI-powered tool that brings **static drawings to life** in minutes.  
It simplifies animation by letting artists **upload artwork, pick a motion style, and instantly generate animated sequences**. No complex software or skills needed.

Built with deep learning, it analyzes lines and shapes to apply natural movement, cutting animation time by up to **80%**.  
Perfect for solo creators, small teams, and anyone looking to animate without the usual hassle.
